                        world we live in today has a
                        lot of behaviours that are considered normal. Something as simple as getting a star for a good
                        drawing
                        as a child plays it's role in teaching us that our worth is based on the approval of an external
                        opinion,
                        other than ourselves. As a child we learn that approval means acceptance, and being accepted
                        means
                        that we
                        have that relationship we depend on for survival.<br/><br/> In moments a child does not feel
                        safe and
                        feels they could lose the relationship they depend on for survival, their

                        to conform with the desire and approval of their caregivers. This behaviour has become normal
                        and
                        in some cases, is expected. <br/><br/> We then carry this
                        behaviour over to adulthood and in order to feel safe the only way we learnt how to, we
                        constantly
                        search for that approval externally. In some extreme cases, someone seeking external validation
                        would be considered as a people pleaser.<br/><br/> To learn more about why we seek
                        external validation watch <Clickable href="https://youtu.be/SaJq3Yx436M" target>"Why We Seek External Validation"</Clickable> video On YouTube.</p>

                    friend? The only difference is we can get away from that friend, but we cannot get away from
                    ourselves.<br/><br/>Learn how to accept the ego and change the judgmental thoughts you have about
                    yourself given to you by others. <br/><br/>Being aware of how you treat yourself is one of the most

                    Being humans, at our core we are relationally dependent. We have relationships with everyone in our
                    lives. Growing up we learn about relationships in our environment. How to treat others, what‚Äôs ok to
                    do and what‚Äôs not ok to do. Our experiences teach us what our version of love is.<br/><br/>We all
                    have relationship dynamics. These are patterns of behaviour between people in the ways that we
                    relate, communicate and interact with each other. <br/><br/>Recognising the dynamics that play out
                    in our relationships puts us in a very powerful position. It allows us to navigate the challenges we
                    face with each other. We increase compassion and experience more love and fulfillment throughout our
                    days.</p>
